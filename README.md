# Loganalyzer

Loganalyzer is a web application consisting of a frontend and a backend connected to a MongoDB database. This project is designed to analyze logs and visualize the data in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

### Backend

- âœ… Parses Linux log files (`/var/log/syslog`)
- âœ… Stores logs in MongoDB
- âœ… Provides a REST API:
  - `/logs`: Endpoint for retrieving log data
  - `/upload`: Endpoint for uploading logs

### Upcoming Features (ToDo)

- ðŸ”œ Provide a REST API `/logs/:id` for retrieving individual log entries
- ðŸ”œ AI-powered issue detection & fixes (Potential integration with OpenAI or Gemini)
- ðŸ”œ Real-time log streaming via WebSockets
- ðŸ”œ Dashboard route for visualizing log data (date, time, count, etc.)

## Project Structure

- `frontend`: The frontend of the web application, built with a modern JavaScript framework.
- `backend`: The backend API that serves the data to the frontend, using Node.js and MongoDB.
- `db`: MongoDB container used to store the logs data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dineshsutihar/Log-Analyzer.git
cd Log-Analyzer
```

### 2. Setup Build and Start the Containers

You can use Docker Compose to build and start the containers. In your terminal, run the following:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build the images for the frontend, backend, and database, and then start the services.

### 3. Access the Application

- Frontend: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to access the web application.
- API: The backend API is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Stopping the Application

To stop the containers, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers but preserve the data in the MongoDB volume.

## Folder Structure

Here is the folder structure of the project:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/                  # Backend API code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/                 # Frontend application code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml        # Docker Compose file to manage containers
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # This file
```

## Troubleshooting

If you face any issues while running the application, here are some common checks:

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are correctly installed.
- Check container logs using:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs <service-name>
  ```
  For example, to view frontend logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs web
  ```

## Development

To develop locally on your machine, follow these steps:
Also, to set up individually, you may require a `.env` file with some required data.

1. Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # For the frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # For the backend
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the frontend and backend services separately (if not using Docker Compose):

   ```bash
   # Start the backend
   npm run dev

   # Start the frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Docker Volumes

The project uses a Docker volume for MongoDB to persist data. You can view the volume with:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

To remove the volume (if needed):

```bash
docker volume rm mongodb_data
```
